# CS465_LiesendahlJ

Hello, This is my final submission, I just wanted to say that I tried pretty hard to make a solid project, it's been extremely hard to work with the 5 cs course load I have currently going, but I should now only have one class in the summer as long as all goes, I do want to apologize for not being as focused as I should have been at the start of the semesters with my original group; however, I also had some stuff going on outside of school at the time that I did have to deal with. I believe that the project I am delivering is well made and shows what I have learned, especially coming into this class knowing absolutely nothing about unreal engine. Thanks

Instructions for Prototype:
To start
Load the project into unreal engine and enter into the vr preview.
There are 4 buttons that will spawn in front of the user, the Green is a hand grasp trial, that you will use your right controller to grasp each sphere that comes up and after 10 the trail will end and go back to the other options, yellow is the hand grasp breadth trial, similar to the first; however, targets will go across a different axis. The other two use a ray projected from the right oculus controller, Red is for depth ray-cast trial, and blue is for breadth ray-cast trail. To select and option use the grab button on the oculus controller. A trial will run for 10 spheres and then send you back to the main selection.
